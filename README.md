Note that event APIs may have usage limitations such as a request limit per minute or access restrictions. If you experience any issues with the application, check if you need an API key or if you're exceeding usage limits.

This application is just an example and can be customized and enhanced to fit your specific needs. Feel free to modify the code and add new features as needed.
